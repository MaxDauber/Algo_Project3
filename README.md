Dynamic programming project to show 

Driver.java is the main driver program. Use command line arguments to choose between Constrained Shortest Path and Optimal Resource Allocation and to specify an input file.
Use -1 for shortest path, -2 for optimal allocation, and input file name for specified input (i.e. java -classpath . Driver [-1]/[-2] [#.in] on a linux machine). 
  
```python
java Driver -1 #.in
```
